# Neural-network-for-emotion-recognition
Neural network for emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset

Project completed as part of the Machine learning course at Imperial College London.

To execute training of the network you need to run the train_FERdata.py file, but first type the correct directory (in the train_FERdata.py) of the labels_public.txt file which is found in the datasets\public folder.
