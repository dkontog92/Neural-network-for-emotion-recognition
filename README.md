# Neural-network-for-emotion-recognition
Neural network for emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset

Project completed as part of the Machine learning course at Imperial College London.

In linux you need to bash the "getfer2013.sh" file (in the datasets folder) in order for the data to be downloaded.
To perfrom training of the network you need to run the train_FERdata.py file by typing "python train_FERdata.py" in cmd/terminal from within the src directory. You might need to change the lines where the directories of the data are given depending on your OS.
