# Neural-network-for-emotion-recognition
Neural network for emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset

Project completed as part of the Machine learning course at Imperial College London.

To perfrom training of the network you need to run the train_FERdata.py file by typing "python train_FERdata.py" in cmd/terminal from within the src folder. You might need to change the lines where the directories of the data are given depending on your OS.
